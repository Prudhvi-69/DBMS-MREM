Create a table with the name : Employees
Insert multiple columns into it : ID, name, gender, Dept, Salary, Location
 
and find the sum of salaries of all employees in total (not specific to department but sum of all employees in the organisation).




AVG() : it is an aggregare function which will take values from one numerical datatype column and add all of those values and find the average value among all.

** It will work only on numerical datatype columns.
** It can take only one column's values at a time.
** It cannot access multiple columns at once.
** You can use this aggregate function only with group by clause.
** If you want to put a condition on the output, then you can use the having clause, where it is gonna put a condition after group by is executed.

** Now we are gonna check the avg function in the code..... OKAY...?????


NOTE : Always remember, the aggregate functions will return an integer value no matter on how many rows you are performing the operation.

Count -> it will return number of rows
Sum   -> it will return sum of values from all rows
Avg    -> it will return avg of values from all rows
Min    -> it will return smallest value from the column by comparing with all rows
Max   -> it will return largest value from the column by comparing with all rows





min() : it is an aggregate function which will work on multiple rows of a column with numerical datatype.

** First it will take the first value, then compare it with the next value, and continue until the last value in that column.

** And at the end, it returns the lowest/smallest value among all the values in that specific column.

max() : it is an aggregate function which will work on multiple rows of a column with numerical datatype.

** First it will take the first value, then compare it with the next value, and continue until the last value in that column.

** And at the end, it returns the largest/highest value among all the values in that specific column.








Create a table with the name : Employees
Include the columns : Name, ID, Salary, Age, Exp in Years, Level


Create another table witht the name : Promotions 
Include the columns : Promotion_ID, Promoted_Levels, EmpID, Increased_Salary

** Keep the neccesary CONSTRAINTS. 


DECIMAL(10,2) : It is a datatype, where it is going to contain decimal values with precision.

** Mostly it will be used when you want accurate data values.

Syntax : 
			
			Decimal(base value, precision value) 

** Once you are done writing down, start creating the table and work
