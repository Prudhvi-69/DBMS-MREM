INDEX : It will act as a pointer for faster access on the database / tables.

** Index is used on any column in the table for filtering the rows faster from a database containing HUGE number of records.

** Indexing can be applied either on one column separately or on multiple columns at once, depending on the purpose of extracting the data from the database.

** Indexing on a column will take up some extra space in the database for the column which has been indexed for efficiency.


Syntax : 
				create INDEX index_name ON table_name (column / set);
Ex : 
			create INDEX ind_ON_dept ON employees(Dept); 

** It is preferable to create the INDEX on the most frequently used column in the table, instead of least used column.

** If you create an INDEX on a column which is not being used by any query, then it is just a waste of space and time.

** You need to create the INDEX only when you are gonna use that specific column / set of columns while retrieving data from a HUGE Database.
