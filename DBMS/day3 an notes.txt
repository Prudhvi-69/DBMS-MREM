create a table with columns as 

	name

Data Definition Language Commands : the commands under this language are going to effect the structure/schema of the Database but not the data in it.

Commands : 

	create
	alter
	truncate
	drop
	rename(not a command, but a procedure)






truncate : it is going to delete the entire table data, but keeps the structure/schema intact.
Column names, table names, constraints will be kept as it is. 
Ex : 				truncate table B2;

drop : it will work on 2 scenarios. 
	for columns : it is going to delete the entire column including it's name and all the values in it.

	for table : it is going to delete the entire table data, constraints, column names, table name.
**Nothing will be there in the database related to something you have droppped



Data Manipulation Language commands : these commands are going to update, delete, change the data inside the table.

	insert
	update
	delete

 
Data Query Language command : 

	select


'Prakash'  -> 'Rakash' -> 'Prakash'
