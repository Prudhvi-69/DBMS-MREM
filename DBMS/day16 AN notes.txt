If till now it is clear with the joins, we can proceed to something next.

If anyone is having doubts, problems, issues, errors while working/understanding the joins.

Raise your hands and we'll finish it off here itself.






Subqueries :  It is a query inside another query, but it can be used only with a specific clauses.

** It can have multiple queries at once, but each one should be acting as the output for the outside query.

** The outside query is known as main query, the inside query is known as subquery.

** Each subquery output will be checked with the clause present at the end of main query.

** It can be used with the clauses : where, from, select, having, but not with order by.

** Order by requires the name of a column, but a subquery will always return the rows but not the column.

** Subqueries output can be checked with the help of clauses and a conditional operator from the main query.

** The output of the subquery should always be matching with the ending comparison part of the main query.

** Both datatypes should be same and in most of the cases, selecting column from the subquery should be same as ending query in the main query.
