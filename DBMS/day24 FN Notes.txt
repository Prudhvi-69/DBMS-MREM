Functions : It is a stored procedure in SQL, where it will be containing the code execute either on the table or off the table.

** Main advantage of functions is, code reusability and time efficient compared to a normal query.

** It is going to store the output in it and can be called whenever needed by the help of the command : EXEC (execuute).

** It is going to take input parameters into the code/function, which you can use inside the code.

** There will be no output parameters for a function in SQL.

** A function in SQL, must always return a value/scalar(table).


Syntax for creating :
 
					create function function_name (parameter_name datatype)					
					returns return_datatype
					begin
								-- code of the function
								return value
					end	

Example function for adding two values taken as parameters into the function: 

				create function addition(@value1 int, @value2 int)
				returns int
				begin
							return @value1 + @value2
				end	
				
Syntax for calling the function : 
				
				1st scenario : when the function's return value is only one exact value (not table)
	
				select dbo.function_name( parameters, if applicable );

Ex : Calling the addition function 

				select dbo.addition( 10,59 ); 


Procedures : It is also known as stored procedure where you write some logic for extracting the data from the table or tables.

** You can retreive whenever needed from a procedure instead of writing the query.

** The main difference between a function and a procedure will be, the function must always return a value, where as a procedure may not.

** Procedures will also have an advantage of passing the output parameter where it is not present in the functions(allows input parameters only).

** Procedures have to be runned by the command : EXEC (execute).

** You can store multiple rows of a table with multiple columns inside a procedure.

Syntax for creating a procedure : 
					
					create procedure procedure_name 
					input parameters (if applicable)
					output parameters (if applicable)	
					AS
					begin 
								-- query inside the procedure
					end


executing the procedure : 
					
					EXEC procedure_name


deleting the procedure : 
			
					drop procedure procedure_name
