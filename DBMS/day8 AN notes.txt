LIKE : it is something similar to a constraint, but you can use it for retrieving the values from a table.

There are multiple ways in which you can use LIKE.

** It is used to find a specific character pattern inside any character type column.

** It is used inside the select command query, and can be used with where clause.

** LIKE can be used under three scenarios.,
	-> When you want to search some character/set at the beginning.
	-> When you want to search some character/set at the ending.
	-> When you want to search some character/set in the middle.

** Searching at the beginning with LIKE
	
Syntax : 
				select columns from table where LIKE  '[search character] %'

** Searching at the ending with LIKE
	
Syntax : 
			select columns from table where LIKE '% [search character/set]'

** Searching in the middle/when you dont know where it is present
Syntax : 
			
			select columns from table where LIKE '% [search character/set] %'



Order by clause : this is going to return the table columns in an ordered way based on the condition and the column which you are mentioning.

** Order by can only be used inside a select command, it cannot be used without a select on it's own.

** The default order to display will be ascending, when used with order by clause.

** If you want the columns displayed in descending order, you need to use a keyword known as "desc".

** It will work on any datatype inside the SQL and also DATEs.


** Where and order by, are known as filtering and sorting methods in SQL.
