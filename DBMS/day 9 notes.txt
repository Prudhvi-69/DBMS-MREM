Identity() : It is a builtin function/constraint, which is going to contain 2 parameters.

** It is known for it's default replacement for NULL values.

** 1st parameter is known for the starting value.

** 2nd parameter is known for the incremental value.

** It will update, each time when you insert a new record into the table using insert command.

Syntax : 

	column_name numerical_datatype identity(start_value, incremental_value);

** You can create an identity during the creation of the table.
