Data Abstraction : Keeping an extra layer of security or protection on the data inside the database can be referred as Data Abstraction in Databases.

** It will be useful when you want restrict people/person from accessing the full content inside the Database, and make them have access/authority over a specific part of the data.

** This process of hiding/ securing / protecting the data can be achieved in DBMS with the help of the concept called : VIEWS.
	

Views : It is a way to represent and extract the data from the table(s) but that extracted data cannot be stored anywhere physically.

** It can be used as a virtual data storage space to work and restrict the data access for specific users and commands.

** You can create views based out of certain conditions and extract the data from that view and put a filter on it for further modifications.

** Most importantly views can be created from the output of a select query on one more tables.

Syntax : 
					create view view_name as select columns from table_name;

Ex : 
		create view top_five as select top 5 * from employees 
		order by salary desc;
