Data Query Language : it is used to retrieve the data from the database/tables.

It is not going to affect the database schema or the data inside it.

That is the reason it is not going to be considered either under DDL, or DML. So it is coming under DQL.

**There is only one command in DQL, i.e., select.

Syntax : 
 


/*Renaming one column in the output console using an alias*/
				select Name,DOB,Roll as ID from B3;
/*Renaming all columns in the output console using an alias*/
				select Name as peru, DOB as date, Roll as ID from B3;




Constraints : Constraints in SQL are to put a specific condition on the table/database, to restrict the user from giving the duplicated values, or the data based on rules/conditions.

Unique : it is a key constraint, where you must need to give the input specified by this constraint, has to be UNIQUE in input.
** It will not tolerate any duplicate values.

**If you are trying to insert the duplicate values it is going to give you the error message : 
---- Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint
---- Cannot insert duplicate key in object (table_name)
---- The duplicate value is (value)

EX: 
			create table MEI(name varchar(20),ID int unique);

**Unique key constraint allows NULL values also(when you dont enter any value in that specific column, it'll be considere as NULL until you enter any value).
** There can be multiple UNIQUE KEY constraints in one table.



Primary Key : it is a key constraint, where you must need to give the input specified by this constraint, has to be UNIQUE in input.
** It will not tolerate any duplicate values.
** Also it will not tolerate any NULL values.
** There has to be only ONE primary key in the table.




create table IME(name varchar(20),ID int primary key, mobile char(10) UNIQUE, gender char(1));

insert into IME values('Bhanu',39,'8745205652','f');
insert into IME values('Tushar',28,'4145205652','m');
insert into IME values('Akshith',8,'874585252','m');






Error message when you are not giving any value in Primary key field: 

Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'ID', table 'Batch1.IME'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.

Be sure be back by 11:21 29-11-2024










NOT NULL : This is a constraint where it is going to follow the rules of always keeping a value in the column.
If you are not entering any value in a NOT NULL constraint column, it is going to give you error message.

**NOT NULL can allow duplicate values.


Error when you dont give any value in the NOT NULL column : 

Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'name', table 'Batch1.dbo.EMI'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.




Default : it is going to put a default value in the column of any row you apply it to, only when you dont provide any value inside that column for that specific row.
