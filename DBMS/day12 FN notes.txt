group by : it is a clause used to combine multiple rows of a same table.

** When you use group by, there will be UNIQUE, identified columns.

** You can use aggregate functions with the help of group by, efficiently.

** This will be not used to get the details of individual rows but to get the data of combined rows based on a column.

** When you use group by, you cannot retrieve all the columns but only the column which you are grouping and use defined columns with the output containing from aggregate functions.



Aggregate functions : These function in SQL are built-in, can be used to perform certain operations where it takes lot of effort,, so these functions can replace your efforts with ease and get the results faster.	

Functions : 
	-> count()
	-> sum()
	-> min()
	-> max()
	-> avg()

Count() : it is used to count the number of rows retrieved from a select command.

** It can be used only when you use group by clause.
** It cannot be used with where clause.

Ex: 
			select column, count(*) from table group by column;



SUM(): It is an aggregate function which is going to work on numerical datatype columns, it is going to return an integer value.

** It will add all the values based on the condition from the select command, and it will return the result in integer format.

** It will work on only one column at a time, because you cannot add two different column values at once.

** Sum() is going to take one parameter as the name of the column with numerical datatype.



AVG() : it is an aggregate function which is going to work on numerical datatype columns.

** It is going to add all the numerical values in the column and find the average value of those added values.

** It will return an integer value without any column name

** If you want to mention any column name for this, use an alias.
