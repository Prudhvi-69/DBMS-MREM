Good ********* Everyone...






Create a table with the name : Employees
with the columns : empID, empName, Dept, Salary, DOJ, Location, Gender

** Do not forget to use neccesary constraints.
** Salary may include something like : Rs. 69058.54  (keep it in mind).
** First create without float value for salary, then we can modify later.
** For now, create salary with int only.


** After creating the table, now you need to select the departments whose employees salaries are as a total more than 100000.



** Where is going to retrieve by filtering.
** Group by is going to combine multiple rows into one.

** You can use only where depending on purpose.
** You can use only group by clause depending on purpose
** When you are using both where and group by, remember, always to keep
where clause at first, then group by after that. It is a sequence which we must follow.

** When you use group by clause, remember to use the grouping column specifically in the retrieving columns.

** When you use group by clause, you can use aggregate functions effectively.

Where : It is going to filter before group by

Group by : It is going to combine multiple rows

Having : It is going to filter after group by

Having : The Having clause is going to filter the rows/results after performing the group by clause. 

** When you are using having, it should not be used individually, rather, it should be merged with the group by clause.

** Having clause should always exist after group by clause.

Syntax : 

		select columns from table group by column having condition; 











sum() : it is going to perform an arithmatic operation addition on numerical datatype columns.

**You can use this when you performing group by and also having.

** You cannot use this function when working only with where clause.

Syntax : 		
				select sum(integer_column) as alias from table group by another_column;
Ex: 
				select Dept, sum(salary) from employees group by dept

/*This will display the Total Salary of all employees in each Department*/
