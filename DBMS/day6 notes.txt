For CSI, CSM, CSE also have to be in this class for today.

Call/text to others.....
Today full day class in this room only for both batches.

SIT





As we are having both the batches today, i am not intending to take a full day class, instead, we can work on creating relations between multiple tables.

We'll try working on different databases in addition to that, we can create and take a huge amount of data to work.







We can start with a concept that is one of important one in building relationships between two _____.




It is a Primary key but not in the current table.

It is a Primary key but there can be multiple in one table.





Foreign Key : It is a constraint used to establish the connection between two tables.

**Every foreign key must be a Primary key in some table with which you want to build the relationship.

**It can present multiple times in one table where it is not the Primary key but a Foreign Key.(You can have multiple foreign keys in the table where you are creating the relationship).

**Before creating a constraint with Foreign Key, always remember to create a table with the same name must be Primary key in some table.


Syntax :

		foreign key (current_table foreignKEY ID) references 
						parentTable.parentPrimaryKey;


1. create members table
2. insert data into that table
3. create books table
4. insert data into that table
5. follow the below code : 

CREATE TABLE Borrowings (
    Borrowing_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Member_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Book_ID INT NOT NULL,
    Borrow_Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Return_Date DATE DEFAULT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Member_ID) REFERENCES Members(Member_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Book_ID) REFERENCES Books(Book_ID)
);




1. How many books one person has borrowed
2. How many people have borrowed one specific book
