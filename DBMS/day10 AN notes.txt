Order by : order by clause is used to sort the data in the output console. 

** It can be applied on to any column in the table.

** The default sorting order would be ascending order.

** When you apply order by on 
	Integer -> lowest value first, largest value last
	char     -> A,a will be first, then Z,z will be last	
	DATE  -> Old date will be first, Latest date will be last
	
** When you want to sort based on descending order, you need to use the keyword "desc" after order by.


Syntax : for ascending
				select columns from table order by (oen of the columns);

for descending order
				select columns from table order by (one of the columns) desc;
