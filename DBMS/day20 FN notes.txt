How many of you created a table  with HUGE rows?









To delete the INDEX : 

** You cannot delete directly the index from the database.

** You can delete the index on the index, by mentioning the command, DROP.

Syntax : 
						drop index index_name ON table_name;

** When you drop an index, the time optimisation will be gone/removed on the table also, making it take the default more time to retrieve the data.

** If you want to make it retrieve faster, you need to create the index again on the required column(s) on the table you want to optimize;
