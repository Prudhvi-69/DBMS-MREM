Create a table with the name college, and include a column Department.

So, there can be multiple people from one department right?

Include the Set of Departments as : CSE, ECE, IT

Insert multiple records into the table and include people from multiple departments be present in any one of those mentioned.

Make sure, every student should belong to any of the Department, so that no one will be left without a Department.

So, inorder to perform these operations and make this work, use neccesary constraints and insert atleast 10 records for easy work flow.



Aggregate functions : builtin functions which will perform some operation on multiple rows in a table which belongs to one column.

Aggregate functions are :
	-> count()
	-> sum()
	-> avg()
	-> min()
	-> max()

** Each function will perform a specific task desgined for it.
** Each of the functions are going to return a value as output and you need to create an alias to get the result and display at the output console.
** There is a certain condition and limitations for these aggregate functions, where these functions will not effect the original data inside the table/database. It is for the user, on the output console.



count() : it is an aggregate function to count the number of rows present in the resulting column based on the retrieving query.

** It always require as alias while displaying the result. The default column when you dont mention any alias will be : (no column name)

syntax : 
					select resulting_columns, count(counting_column) from
	table_name condition...

** When you are retrieving data from the table : college, and if you want to get the total count of people from a specific department.

** select count(*) from college where department='dept_name'





Question : Retrieve data and count of people from each department, with the help of one Select query.

Solution : 
select department, count(*) as Total from college group by department;

(Use group by clause)


Group by : it is a grouping clause where you want the data in the output console to be grouped under a specific order.

** The advatage of this group by clause is that you can  aggregate functions effectively.

** You can use every aggregate function with the help of group by clause.

** It is used to contain the data in a format where you can group different rows under one specific column.

** Also remember, you can perform group by under one column efficiently.

** Performing group by operation on multiple columns will result in scattering of data.

** Where clause will retrieve the data based on a condition,
	Group by clause will combine the specific rows under one name for easy identification.


Retrieve the data of student's name, ID and specific gender, where ID between 10 and 40;
