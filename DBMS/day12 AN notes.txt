JOINS : This concept of joins will be used to extract/retrieve data from multiple tables without actually creating a link between them.

** When you use joins, you dont need to have an explicit link form foreign key to build the relationship.

** Depending on where you want the data from, you can use a different join to retrieve the data from multiple tables.

Types of Joins : 
1. Inner Join 
2. Outer Join ___
								 |
							1. Left Outer Join
							2. Right Outer Join
							3. Full Outer Join
3. Cross Join 

1. Inner Join : It is a type of join, where we can get the common rows from the both tables, only where the condition is matched.

** It is going to perform the same operation as intersection, to get the common matching records from both the tables.

** It will omit the rows/records which are not matching in both tables.

write about your Example : 



2. Outer Join 

1. Left Outer Join : It is going to extract/ retrieve the columns from the left side table when the condition is matched.


Ex: When you want the data of employees who got promotions.

** If a record is not matched in the right side table, it is going to put a NULL value in that column for the respective row.

2. Right Outer Join : It is going to extract/ retrieve the columns/rows from the right side table when the condition is matched.

** It will retrieve all the rows from the right side table which are matched with the condition but not all rows from the left side table.

** It will keep NULL values in the left side table columns for those didn't matched with the right side table.
