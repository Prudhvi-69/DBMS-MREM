Trigger : It is a stored procedure, which is going to activate when an event occurs.

** Event can be, an insertion statement, any updation statement, or it can be any deletion statement.
	
** Triggers can be accessed through the select command.

** You can store the data inside the trigger, based on the events occuring on the table.

** It is used for storing auditing data, log data, records of updations, modifications, additional things that will make changes on the data in the table.

** Consider something like, storing daily attendance of students, or every semester each subject marks log data.

** These kind of things require, the data from a previously existing table and the changes been made in that table will be recorded in an extra table for auditing purpose.

** For storing the trigger data, we need to create an extra table.
