Order by : this is a clause used to sort the data in the output console when you use select command.

**The default order for sorting will be ascending order.
** You need to mention the column by which you want to sort the output.

**If you want the data in the output console to be sorted in descending order, mention the keyword "desc" at the end.

** This sorting will work on int,char,varchar,date.


NOT NULL : This constraint is going to restrict from keeping any column value NULL/empty.

**When you mention some column with NOT NULL, you must give some value in it, if you dont, you'll get error.

**NOT NULL constraint allows duplicate values.

**


**Check** (Another constraint) : it is going to put a condition on the input, while inserting the value with insert command, if the value is not meeting the constraint set by "check" it is going to give you error.

** Usually used for taking inputs when you have limted values.
Ex:
			marks int check (marks between 0 and 100);
Ex:
			gender char(1) check (gender in ('f','m','o'));

**This is going to check whether the input VALID or NOT
