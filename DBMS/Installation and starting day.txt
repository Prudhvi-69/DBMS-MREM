After installation process is done(SQL, SSMS), connect to the DB.

Before doing any operation/query, click on new QUERY option in
menu bar.

Then create a new database.
Syntax : 
					create database name_of_DB;
EX: 
					create database Batch1;

**After the database is created if you want to work inside the database, you need to use the keyword and query

Syntax : 
					use Database_name;
ex: 	
					use Batch1;

**Now once you have mentioned that you are going to use the database, you can create a new table to insert the data and store the data/perform oeprations on data/modifications/deletion/retrieval of data.

Syntax : 
					create table name_of_the_table(columns(attributes),.....);
Ex:
					create table Data(Name varchar(20), ID int, gender varchar(1));

**After executing each query, refresh the database panel/Object Explorer. Then you can see the changes you have made.

Then : 11:22 27-11-2024

Be back in 10, i.e., by 11.34

Now : 11:39 27-11-2024





//opening the database
use Batch1;
//creating the table with columns/attributes 
create table Candidate(name varchar(68),CID int);
//inserting values into the table
insert into Candidate values('Renuka',25);
//retrieving values from the table
select * from Candidate;


//Inserting multiple rows at once : 
**It can be done with a separator operator ,


insert into Candidate values('Harika',55),('Shubhangi',31);


H_W / R_W: 


0. Finish the installation process totally (do not have any pending process in the installation process).
*** The only you can do the creation of the database and do the home/hostel/rooom work properly without any deviations...


1. Create a Database with your class name.
2. Create a Table with name Data
3. Insert atleast 50 values into it.
4. (Those with most number of records will get a reward).
5. Anyone missing to do the work, will be facing serious
    consequences.
