Min():it is an aggrigate function which is going to work on the numerical data type column.
**it will take first value compare it with the next value in the column.
**it will return an integer value which is the lowest among all values in the coloumn.

Syntax:select min(column)from table:
/*gives you the minimum value from the numerical datatype colunm */

Max:it is an aggrigate function which is going to work on the numerical data type on the column.
**it will take the first value compare it with next value untill the last value in the column 
**it will return an integer value which is the highest among all values in that columnn.
Syntax:select max(column)from table.
/gives you the maximum value from the numerical datatype column/


SELECT TOP:

It is a select command modified with an extra clause keyword,know as top.
**it is used to find the specific number of rows from the table.
**it can be used on the one column or all column of the table.

JOINS : it is a concept to retrieve/ extract data from multiple tables at once without having an external link between.

** There is no need of any foreign key constraint to extract data from multiple tables with the help of the concept JOINS.

** Depending on from where you want the data, you can use/choose the type of the joining.

** Types of Joins in SQL : 
	-> Inner Join 
	-> Outer Join ___
							|
							-> Left Outer Join
							-> Right Outer Join
							-> Full Outer Join
	-> Cross Join
	-> Self Join


** Inner Join : It is a type of join, where the data from both the tables is going to be extracted only when there is a common match based on the condition.

** If the condition is not matched, it is not at all going to retrieve that specific row.

** If the condition is matched, it is going to retrieve columns from right side table and left side table.

** It will bring out the common rows present in both tables, it works in a similar way as intersection in mathematics.
